# Vibration Signal Processing

* Experimental Modal Analysis
  * Modal Analysis calculated by hands
* FRF Generation
  * FRF Generation (by nature frequency, modal damping ratio and modal stiffness)
  * Residue FRF (by nature frequency, modal damping ratio and residue of esch modals; one from X. W. Liu, another from Y. Altintas)
* Impact Testing
  * FFT Method
  * Impact Signals processing (Including FRF, Cross-power spectrum, Autospectrum, Coherence Calculation)
* Modal Parameter Identification
  * Rational Fraction Polynomial (a frequency method to identify modal parameters)
* Post-Processing
  * FFT (Zero padding)
* Pre-Processing
  * Trend Term Elimination
