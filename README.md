# Vibration Signal Processing
* Pre-Processing
  * Trend Term Elimination
  * Data Smoothing 
* Modal Parameter Identification
  * Rational Fraction Polynomial (a frequency method to identify modal parameters)
* FRF Generation
  * FRF Generation (by nature frequency, modal damping ratio and modal stiffness)
  * Residue FRF (by nature frequency, modal damping ratio and residue of esch modals; one from X. W. Liu, another from Y. Altintas)
